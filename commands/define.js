This shape accepts eight tiles, same as a ryanmen, but takes up three tiles in the hand instead of two. It's pretty strong, and is usually kept around until all the other blocks in the hand are better.",
    "blocks": "A block in a hand is either a completed set, or a potential set. You usually want five, as a hand needs four sets and a pair to be complete. Check `!link block` for an introduction to five block theory.",

Additionally, you get two fu if you have a single wait (a tanki, kanchan, or penchan). You also get two fu if your pair is yakuhai, or four fu if it's a double wind. Finally, you get 2 fu if you tsumo, and 10 fu if you win by ron with a closed hand. This is rounded up to the nearest 10, so a 32 fu hand would become a 40 fu hand. The exception to all this is chiitoitsu, which is always 25 fu. Also, if you score pinfu and tsumo, you only get 20 fu. Also also, if a hand scores 20 fu but is open, it goes up to 30 fu due to the open pinfu rule. Phew. Ask something simpler next time.",

    "sakigiri": "Sakigiri is when you cut a tile earlier than efficiency would normally dictate. For example, you might cut a 7 from a 677 shape early on to hide your matagi suji or because you expect the 7 to be dangerous later.",
    "matagi": "Matagi suji refers to tiles within two steps of a tile. It arises from shapes like 677. It's a strong shape, so you'd keep it for later, then when you call riichi, discard the 7 for a 5-8 wait. If it was 778, your wait would be 6-9. So, 5689 are matagi suji. This usually applies to the riichi tile and the last tedashi of an efficient player.",
    "sotogawa": "Sotogawa refers to tiles outside of those discarded early by a player. For example, if they discarded a 3s early on, they likely aren't waiting on 12s. This is because a 233s or 334s shape is pretty strong and would likely be kept.",

    "sujitrap": "A suji trap wait is a wait that looks safe to your opponents due to suji theories. For example, if you have a 5 in your discards, a 13 kanchan would be a suji trap wait, since the 2 is suji of the 5.",
    "trap": "A trap wait is a wait that looks safe in the eyes of the opponents. For example, having a 13 kanchan wait would be a suji trap if you had a 5 in your discards. A tanki on a 9 would be a sotogawa trap if you had an early 7 in your discards, and so on.",
    "otoshi": "Otoshi is used when someone cuts a partial set from their hand. If they cut a 2s from their hand, then cut another 2s from their hand, it would be a toitsu (pair) otoshi.

This is usually done to confirm yaku, such as sanshoku, itsu, or tanyao, to incorporate a dora, or because the other tile is safer.",
