Finally, you get 2 fu if you tsumo, and 10 fu if you win by ron with a closed hand. This is rounded up to the nearest 10, so a 32 fu hand would become a 40 fu hand. The exception to all this is chiitoitsu, which is always 25 fu. Also, if you score pinfu and tsumo, you only get 20 fu.

    "toitsuba": "A toitsuba is a round in which many pairs are drawn.",
    "paifu": "A paifu is a game record that tracks all the draws and discards each players made. Usually this will just be a replay.",
    "han": "Han are the multipliers for a hand's points. Each han multiplies your minipoints (fu) by two. There's an implicit two han, known as bazoro, so the base score is fu * (2 ^ (2 + han)), rounded up to the nearest 100.",
    "dorasoba": "A dorasoba is a tile near the dora.",
    "kyoutaku": "Kyoutaku refers to the points on the table, ie the riichi sticks and honba.",
    "buttobi": "Buttobi is the state of being tobi (below zero points).",
    "deadhand": "When you make an error that's severe, but not severe enough to cause the game to be unable to continue, you can be declared to have a dead hand. With a dead hand, you are not allowed to declare a win. Not by ron, not by tsumo. An example of such a mistake could be declaring ron, then realizing you are unable to.",
    "chombo": "When you make an error that prevents the game from continuing, you have to pay a chombo penalty. Sometimes this will be a reverse mangan, where each other player gets as many points as they would have paid you had you won a mangan tsumo. Sometimes it will be 30,000 points removed from your score at the end of the match. An example of this could be declaring a win, revealing your hand, but your hand not being valid.",
    "sokuri": "Sokuri is the Japanese word for insta-riichi.",
    "civilwar": "Civil War is an old yaku from the Western Classical ruleset. It involves having a triplet of norths, a triplet of souths, the numbers 1861 in one suit, and the numbers 1865 in another.",
    "tomato": "Tomato is what people say when someone discards a tile, then a different tile, then the same tile. Example discards: <:3z:466437922560671744><:1p:466437920908378113><:3z:466437922560671744>",
    "toutenkou": "Toutenkou is a special sanma mode popular in Kanto, currently in beta on Tenhou. The scoring is completely different, and it includes the <:5m:466437922401419274> tiles. Most points come from nukidora (gari) and kans rather than yaku, but hands do still need a yaku. More info at http://arcturus.su/wiki/Toutenkou.",
    "gari": "Gari is another word for nukidora, ie, the cut <:4z:466437922518728744> in sanma and the cut <:1m:466437920698531841><:5m:466437922401419274><:9m:466437922430648330> in Toutenkou.",
    "karasu": "Karasu is a bonus in Toutenkou when your hand has no nukidora, no discarded <:4z:466437922518728744><:1m:466437920698531841><:5m:466437922401419274><:9m:466437922430648330>, and none of those tiles in your hand. This adds 20 points if closed (as much as a yakuman), and 10 points if open.",
    "banban": "Banban is a bonus in Toutenkou which adds 2 points to any winning hand.",
    "natsuki": "Natsuki is my name! It's written with the characters 那, which the dictionary defines as \"what?\" and 月, which is \"moon\". The ⓝ is what identifies bots on Tenhou.",
    "sakizumo": "Sakizumo is the act of drawing earlier than the pace of the game dictates. It's bad manners, usually done to minimize the amount of time the other players have to make calls. In extreme cases, can even be drawing your tile before the player before you has discarded.",
    "oyakaburi": "Oyakaburi is the dealer payment in a tsumo. So, \"I got fourth because of baiman oyakaburi\" would mean they were dealer when someone had a baiman tsumo, so they had to pay twice as much as the other players.",
    "shonpai": "A shonpai is a live tile. In other words, one that hasn't been discarded yet.",
    "riichi": "Riichi is the name of the game. When you reach tenpai, you can call riichi, placing a 1000 point stick in the middle as a bet. After this, you can no longer change your hand. If you win, you get the riichi yaku, increasing your han by one, and get to check the uradora indicator.",
    "ura": "The uradora indicator is the tile underneath the dora indicator(s). When a player wins by riichi, they reveal the ura indicators, which create new dora, called uradora.",
    "openriichi": "Open riichi is an optional rule, where when you call riichi, you can reveal your hand or your incomplete shapes. If you win, it counts as two han instead of the one from a normal riichi. If someone who isn't in riichi deals into you, it often counts as yakuman.",
    "suufon": "Suufon renda is an abortive draw that happens when each player discards the same wind in the first round, eg all four first discards being <:3z:466437922560671744> with no calls.",
    "suucha": "Suucha riichi is an abortive draw that happens when all four players declare riichi.",
    "sanchahou": "Sanchahou is an abortive draw that happens when three players call ron on the same tile. Majsoul doesn't use this rule. Sometimes, when a double ron is called, the third player has to reveal their hand to verify that a triple ron wouldn't have happened.",
    "suukaikan": "Suukaikan is an abortive draw that happens when there are four kans declared by different players. If one player calls all four, they are in suukantsu tenpai, and the game continues.",
    "yakuman": "A yakuman is the highest limit a hand can get. As a non-dealer, it's worth 32000 points, and as dealer, it's worth 48000. You get this if you have 13+ hand (kazoe yakuman), or a certain named yakuman, such as Kokushi Musou.",
    "chii": "A chii is a call where you take a tile from the player to your left in order to finish a run. You always place the called tile on the left side, so it might look like <:c4s:667035333640192061><:3s:466437922258681869><:5s:466437922258812929>",

    "kan": "A kan is a call where you either show that you have four of a kind (closed kan / ankan, looks like <:tileBack:466437984216940544><:3s:466437922258681869><:3s:466437922258681869><:tileBack:466437984216940544>) or you take a tile a player just discarded to complete a four of a kind (daiminkan, looks like a longer pon), or you add a tile you just drew to a pon you've already made (shouminkan / added kan, looks like a pon with two sideways tiles on top of each other). When you do this, you draw a new tile from the end of the deadwall as a replacement. If it's a closed kan, you also immediately reveal a new dora indicator, but if it's an open or added kan, the new indicator is revealed after you discard.",
    "mangan": "A mangan is a hand worth 8000 points as a non-dealer, or 12000 points as the dealer. You score a mangan if you have 5 han, or 4 han 40+ fu, or 3 han 70+ fu. A counted mangan, kiriage mangan, is 4 han 30 fu or 3 han 60 fu, which is worth 7700 ron 7900 tsumo as nondealer. Some rulesets round this up to 8000 for simplicity.",
    "haneman": "A haneman is a hand worth 12000 points as a non-dealer, or 18000 points as the dealer. You score a haneman if you have 6 or 7 han.",

    "sanbaiman": "A sanbaiman, triple mangan, is a hand worth 24000 points as a non-dealer, or 36000 points as the dealer. You score a sanbaiman if you have 11 or 12 han. In some rulesets, such as EMA, hands with 13+ han also score sanbaiman instead of being a counted yakuman.",

    "han": "Han are the multipliers for a hand's score. Dora and yaku both contribute to the number of han a hand has.",
    "onechance": "A one-chance is when you can see three of a tile near another tile. For example, if you can see three of the 2s tiles, there's only one 2s left to make a 23s shape, so the 1s is a one-chance (there's one chance for an opponent to have that ryanmen). If you can see three of the 2s AND three of the 3s, then the 1s is a double one-chance.",
    "nochance": "A no-chance tile is when a tile has no chance of dealing in, due to what tiles you can see. This requires all four of each adjacent tile to be visible, as well as three of the tile itself. In this situation, nobody can be waiting on the tile.
